        Donald Ervin Knuth (/kəˈnuːθ/ kə-NOOTH; born January 10, 1938) 
        is an American computer scientist, mathematician, 
        and professor emeritus at Stanford University. 
        He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, 
        informally considered the Nobel Prize of 
        computer science.[4] Knuth has been called the 
        "father of the analysis of algorithms".
        </p>
        
        <p>
        He is the author of the multi-volume work 
        The Art of Computer Programming and contributed
        to the development of the rigorous analysis of 
        the computational complexity of algorithms and 
        systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process,
        he also popularized the asymptotic notation. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches 
        of theoretical computer science, 
        Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, 
        the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, 
        and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.
